# iapgrpaintdemo
My IAP GR-Paint Demo

## Testing
Open gnuradio companion and open the grc file.

```bash

gnuradio-companion
````

This will allow you to augment the code

Assuming a pluto is plugged in you can just run the python program 

```bash
python iapgrpaintdemo.py
```

In a seperate terminal open up gqrx and connect an RTL-SDR. Tune around 915 MHz +/- a MHz or two in order to see pictures.
